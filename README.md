# GAMBIT

A C++ tool for Gene-based Analysis with oMniBus, Integrative Tests

- Implements SKAT, burden, and ACAT gene-based test methods using variant- or region-based functional annotations
- Calculates annotation-stratified gene-based tests (e.g., TWAS/PrediXcan tests using eSNPs, gene-based tests using only coding variants, and gene-based tests using enhancer-to-target-gene maps)
- Calculates omnibus gene-based tests by aggregating across annotation classes
- Inputs: GWAS association summary statistics file (chromosome, position, ref/alt allele, and z-score or beta-hat + se), annotation files, and LD reference panel
